# Full App Description
This is a Front End Reactive Web application that I decided to work on as a way to present my work to prospective employers. I also wanted somewhat of a challenge with an opportunity to learn a new feature of 
react. Thats what inspired me to develop this 3D portfolio application using ThreeJS. I had never used ThreeJS before so I saw this as an opporunity to learn something new. This was also my first time using Vite 
as a build tool. I would say the most impressive feature of the site is the three dimensional objects I built using ThreeJs. I created a three dimensional atom and macbook object that can be seen on the tabs in 
the works section of the home page. I was also able to use simple-react-maps to pinpoint my two locations on a map in both the contacts section of the home page and also the contact page. The contact page sends me an email so if you wnat to hire me, try it out!

# Current Status
At this point this website is basically complete, at least the design features are. I am still always updating the projects sections with new projects I am working on and new skills I am learning

# Still to Come
Maintinence and adding new project data as it comes in
